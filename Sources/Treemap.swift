//
//  Treemap.swift
//  Fuchen
//
//  Pure squarified treemap layout. Given a list of positive weights and
//  a target rectangle, returns a CGRect for each weight that:
//    1. Sums to the target rect with no overlap and no gaps.
//    2. Keeps rectangles as close to square as possible (low aspect
//       ratios are easier to compare visually).
//
//  Algorithm: Bruls, Huijsen & van Wijk (2000), "Squarified Treemaps".
//  Greedy row-packing — walk inputs largest-first, accumulate into the
//  current row, finalize when the next addition would make the worst
//  aspect ratio worse than the current row's. Rotate orientation when
//  the remaining strip becomes wider than tall (and vice versa).
//
//  Pure module — no SwiftUI, no AppKit, no IO. Drives the Analyze tab's
//  treemap (AnalyzeView) but is testable in isolation.
