//  TreemapTests.swift
//  FuchenTests
//
//  Covers the squarified-treemap layout. The algorithm has a few
//  invariants worth pinning so future "perf improvements" can't quietly
//  break them:
//
//    * Total covered area equals the input bounds' area (to within
//      floating-point noise).
//    * No rectangle leaks outside the input bounds.
//    * Larger weights produce larger output rectangles (monotonic).
//    * The order of returned rectangles matches the order of the input
//      weights — callers index into a parallel array of entries.
